Answer 1-
My first attempt gave me 3437 and this was not the result that was expected when looking at the solution
I then placed the age and country queries in brackets to order the query better and ended on a result of
868

Select customerid, firstname, income from customers
WHERE income > 50000 and age < 30 OR age >= 50
AND country = 'Japan' or country = 'Australia'
ORDER by firstname

Select customerid, firstname, income from customers
WHERE income > 50000 and (age < 30 OR age >= 50)
AND (country = 'Japan' or country = 'Australia')
ORDER by firstname

/*
* DB: Store
* Table: Orders
* Question: 
* What was our total sales in June of 2004 for orders over 100 dollars?

I got the following result using the between filter for the date stated above, it differs from the answer but after
checking the solution it gives the same result of 205226.06

My SQL query
SELECT sum(totalamount) from orders
WHERE orderdate between '2004-06-01' and '2004-06-30'
AND totalamount > 100
